# Project
Collection of Political Social Network

## Introduction
A list of Twitter accounts of 4 U.S. presedential candidates is given in a txt file. The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of these accounts. The [networkx](http://networkx.github.io/) library is used to plot these links, as well as print some statistics of the resulting graph.
